                Adobe Animate is what it was renamed to back on December 1, 2015. This move comes as part of an effort to disassociate the program from Adobe Flash Player, acknowledging its increased use for authoring HTML5 and video content, and an effort to begin discouraging the use of Flash Player in favor of web standards-based solutions.The first version under the new name was released February 8, 2016.
